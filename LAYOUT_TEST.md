# Layout Test Verification

## Issue
The application was appearing in half side only instead of using the full page width.

## Changes Made

1. **App.jsx**:
   - Removed padding from Content component: `padding: '0'`

2. **App.css**:
   - Added comprehensive CSS rules to ensure full width usage
   - Removed constraints that were limiting the width
   - Added `width: 100%` to all relevant components
   - Added `!important` overrides for Ant Design constraints

3. **Component Files**:
   - Updated all components (IntervieweeTab, InterviewerTab, CandidateDetailView, InterviewChat) to use full width
   - Added `width: 100%` and `maxWidth: 100%` to container elements
   - Ensured cards and other UI elements take full width

## Verification Steps

1. Open the application in a browser
2. Check that the header spans the full width of the page
3. Check that the tab content uses the full width
4. Switch between Interviewee and Interviewer tabs
5. Verify that all content areas (forms, tables, cards) use full width
6. Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes

## Expected Results

- Application should now use the full width of the browser window
- No side margins or padding limiting the content width
- All UI elements should properly expand to fill available space
- Layout should be consistent across different components
- Responsive design should work correctly on various screen sizes

## Additional Notes

The issue was caused by:
1. Default padding in the Ant Design Layout Content component
2. Width constraints in the CSS that limited the content area
3. Missing width specifications on container elements

All these issues have been addressed with the changes above.
